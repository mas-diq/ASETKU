<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Ideas Behind The Project :bulb:

<p align="justify">
The idea behind this project is to create a simple calculator application that can be used in accounting. The methods that can be used in this application are Payback Period (PP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR). This application can compare the three companies (company 1, company 2, company 3) which is the most profitable based on pre-selected accounting calculations. And also, there is 1 function that can calculate all four methods at once.
